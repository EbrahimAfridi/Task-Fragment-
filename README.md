# Project Name â€” Code Fragmentation

## Overview

This repository showcases the process of code fragmentation for a React project. 
The original code was provided combining UI components and custom hooks within a single file.
To enhance readability, maintainability, and follow the best 
practices, the code has been fragmented into separate folders and files.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders before and after in the after folder you will
find all the changes made by me.

### 1. UI Components

- **Folder Name:** `components`
- **Description:** This folder contains the UI components. 
    Each component has been separated into individual files for better organization and modularity.

### 2. Custom Hooks

- **Folder Name:** `hooks`
- **Description:** The custom hooks used in the application are now placed in this dedicated folder. 
- This follows best practices for organizing reusable logic in React applications.

## Code Fragmentation Process

The process of code fragmentation involved the following steps:

1. **UI Components Separation:**
    - The UI components were initially combined in a single file, leading to reduced readability.
    - Each component was extracted into its own file within the `components` folder.
    - This separation enhances code organization and makes individual components more manageable.

2. **Custom Hooks Refactoring:**
    - The custom hook used in the application was initially part of the main file.
    - It has been moved to its own file within the `hooks` folder, promoting a cleaner project structure.
    - This allows for better maintenance and reuse of custom logic across components.

## Usage

The code fragments can be explored in the respective folders (`components` and `hooks`).

## Notes

- The code has been fragmented with careful consideration of best practices, aiming to improve maintainability and readability.
- The repository structure aligns with common conventions for organizing React projects.
